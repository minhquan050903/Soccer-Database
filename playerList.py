This marked his most outstanding season since joining the blue side of Manchester. However, at that time, Aguero was approaching 28 years old, necessitating the need for Manchester City to find a suitable replacement. The objective of this project was to identify young and talented strikers who could potentially serve as substitutes for Aguero in case his performance declined in the coming years. A program was developed using Python to generate a list of potential strikers from a given players database, and the results were visualized in the form of charts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"76489931","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cfda3df7-49b5-41fe-b5f0-0c36f29ecced","_uuid":"b8771bb6-3425-42e4-8813-05dc5c683e91","papermill":{"duration":0.006073,"end_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.965317","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.959244","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **BOUNDARIES**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1bc408b3","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c17c3e4c-4629-494e-a789-c4ffc7051dc4","_uuid":"0088a025-8e51-45d8-951b-fa554d7a1816","papermill":{"duration":0.006,"end_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.977589","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.971589","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["I decided to preferably search for center-forwards between the ages of 18 and 23. According to Worville's research (2021), Aguero was 28 years old during his peak season, suggesting that he had approximately five more years before reaching the point of experiencing a significant decline in performance associated with the end of a player's career. This presents an opportune moment for young talents to develop themselves before turning 30. \n","In 2016, The Financial Fair Play Rule by UEFA allowed clubs to lose €60m over three years (Solhekol, 2022). In 3 seasons from 2013/2014, Manchester City's revenue was 1.065 billion euros (Satista, 2023) and also in the same period, they spent a total of 200.13 million euros (PlanetFootball, 2022) . This means the blue side of Manchester did not have to care much about the budget with more than 800 million euros for the 2016 summer transfer market.\n","Pep Guardiola, the new manager of Manchester City, is known for his propensity to rotate formations in every match. In an interview before the UEFA Champions League 2012 semi-finals, Guardiola stated, \"Formations don't exist in football anymore.\" During his at Bayern Munich in the 2014/2015 season, Guardiola utilized nine different formations (MacGregor, 2015). However, most of them are the transformation from the standard 4-3-3 formation, which requires the striker can intend the target of passes from his teammates (Tighe, 2012). A target striker is fully qualified for this need. The key role of a target striker is to use their physicality, strength, and positioning to win aerial duels, hold off defenders, and bring other players into the game (Singh, 2022). They often receive long balls, crosses, or direct passes from the defense or midfield, allowing the team to transition from defense to attack effectively. Considering that Pep Guardiola typically employs a 4-3-3 formation, with midfielders like Kevin De Bruyne and wingers responsible for creating assists, the primary responsibility of the chosen striker would be to position themselves adeptly in advanced attacking positions near the opponent's penalty box, receive passes from teammates, and convert them into goals. Therefore, a striker had high goal efficiency is a significant asset. Also, it becomes essential to identify a striker who is proficient with both their left and right foot, also with an ideal height as this attribute aligns with Guardiola's strategic approach (MacGregor, 2015)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"da76ed7c","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"75d08a08-2ee3-4ec0-952b-f7d04fb460bd","_uuid":"8beadf05-b0a1-4dad-8111-cb897da18ea8","papermill":{"duration":0.006007,"end_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.990051","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.984044","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **METHODOLOGIES**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7924bca4","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"624ce7f2-687e-41f5-b5c8-ee26fd77bbe5","_uuid":"e2a3f9fa-a9ce-47aa-93bb-8dc499b0c3e4","papermill":{"duration":0.005963,"end_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:20.002233","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:19.99627","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**DATASET**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5673acf7","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8099f2a4-bcd4-4cd3-a28f-2a7875c5274f","_uuid":"0d22573c-07e6-48a3-a963-3173da4216d0","papermill":{"duration":0.005984,"end_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:20.016042","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T01:32:20.010058","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Looking an appropirate football databas is one of vital foundation for this project.

The \"European Soccer Database\" focuses on players' ratings from 2008 to 2016, specifically in the 11 most popular European leagues. On the other hand, Transfermarkt provides up-to-date information on transfers, market values, and player profiles worldwide (Smith, 2021). Notably, Transfermarkt covers a wider range of players compared to Hugo Mathien's dataset and also includes market values for each player.

code calculates a metric called \"strkore\" for each player, which represents their potential as a striker. The strkore value is calculated based on various factors, including goals scored per minute played, height, age, market value, current club's domestic competition, and foot preference. The calculation uses a combination of weighted factors to determine the overall strkore value for each player:\n","Strkore rating = (Goals per Match * 60%) + (Height * 15%) + (Age * 10%) + (Market Value * 5%) + (League Factor * 10%) + 10% (Bonus if the striker both left and right footed)\n","1.\tGoals per Match:\n","As target strikers, their primary objective is to consistently score goals. Hence, the goals per match metric carries the highest weight, accounting for 60% of the overall rating. This emphasizes the significance of their goal-scoring ability, with players who have a higher average of goals per match achieving a higher rating in the final evaluation.\n","2.\tHeight (meters):\n","It is worth noting that Aguero, with a height of 173 centimeters, did not possess an ideal height for a striker, which likely impacted his ability to score from crosses. The height of a striker plays a role in their ability to score from crosses and aerial duels. Taller strikers, such as Robert Lewandowski, who can effectively finish crosses, are desirable for Pep Guardiola's system. Therefore, height contributes 15% to the Strkore rating, acknowledging its impact on a striker's overall performance.\n","3.\tAge:\n","To simplify the evaluation, I set the weight where strikers between the ages of 18 and 23 will receive a full mark of 1. This age range reflects the potential for growth, development, and the ability to adapt to the team's requirements (Worville, 2021). On the other hand, strikers outside this age range will receive a reduced mark of 0.5. This accounts for the possibility that older players may have valuable experience and maturity, but their potential for improvement may be less significant.\n","4.\tMarket Value :\n","Considering the budget available to Manchester City in the 2015 transfer window, market value is given a weight of 5% in the Strkore rating. To simplify the calculation, different criteria based on market value ranges are established. Strikers with a market value over 100 million euros receive a mark of 0.5, indicating their high value and significance. Those with a market value between 50 and 100 million euros receive a mark of 0.75, while those below 50 million euros receive a mark of 1. This approach considers the relative financial investment associated with the strikers' potential acquisition.\n","5.\tLeague Factor:\n","The league factor rating takes into account the competitiveness and prestige of the league in which a striker plays. Strikers competing in the top five European leagues, namely the English Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A, receive a full mark of 1. These leagues are recognized for their highly competitive environments, suggesting that the strikers have faced strong opponents (Jiang, 2011). Conversely, strikers in leagues outside the top five receive a reduced mark of 0.5, acknowledging the relatively lower level of competition they typically encounter."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"70ba6495","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6a9dd584-b4df-4064-a591-c78fff237635","_uuid":"4cea1f85-fc65-476b-8089-5f4c221d6a13","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-02T01:33:01.362777Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-02T01:33:01.361978Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-02T01:33:01.626887Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-02T01:33:01.62586Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.277893,"end_time":"2023-07-02T01:33:01.631277","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T01:33:01.353384","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style
