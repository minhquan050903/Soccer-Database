This marked his most outstanding season since joining the blue side of Manchester. However, at that time, Aguero was approaching 28 years old, necessitating the need for Manchester City to find a suitable replacement. The objective of this project was to identify young and talented strikers who could potentially serve as substitutes for Aguero in case his performance declined in the coming years. A program was developed using Python to generate a list of potential strikers from a given players database, and the results were visualized in the form of charts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f7fe9838","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"61b6f31f-6cfd-4916-83a9-242ca2219152","_uuid":"52a26ca2-02e6-46e8-a9d5-d044e3e0a283","papermill":{"duration":0.007678,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.044489","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.036811","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **BOUNDARIES**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6faf19d7","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8744d539-1765-4f9b-8e5a-edf74c8d0875","_uuid":"87d0fc5c-caa6-433d-a56a-5a2aec9cab2f","papermill":{"duration":0.00776,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.060439","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.052679","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["I decided to preferably search for center-forwards between the ages of 18 and 23. According to Worville's research (2021), Aguero was 28 years old during his peak season, suggesting that he had approximately five more years before reaching the point of experiencing a significant decline in performance associated with the end of a player's career. This presents an opportune moment for young talents to develop themselves before turning 30. \n","In 2016, The Financial Fair Play Rule by UEFA allowed clubs to lose â‚¬60m over three years (Solhekol, 2022). In 3 seasons from 2013/2014, Manchester City's revenue was 1.065 billion euros (Satista, 2023) and also in the same period, they spent a total of 200.13 million euros (PlanetFootball, 2022) . This means the blue side of Manchester did not have to care much about the budget with more than 800 million euros for the 2016 summer transfer market.\n","Pep Guardiola, the new manager of Manchester City, is known for his propensity to rotate formations in every match. In an interview before the UEFA Champions League 2012 semi-finals, Guardiola stated, \"Formations don't exist in football anymore.\" During his at Bayern Munich in the 2014/2015 season, Guardiola utilized nine different formations (MacGregor, 2015). However, most of them are the transformation from the standard 4-3-3 formation, which requires the striker can intend the target of passes from his teammates (Tighe, 2012). A target striker is fully qualified for this need. The key role of a target striker is to use their physicality, strength, and positioning to win aerial duels, hold off defenders, and bring other players into the game (Singh, 2022). They often receive long balls, crosses, or direct passes from the defense or midfield, allowing the team to transition from defense to attack effectively. Considering that Pep Guardiola typically employs a 4-3-3 formation, with midfielders like Kevin De Bruyne and wingers responsible for creating assists, the primary responsibility of the chosen striker would be to position themselves adeptly in advanced attacking positions near the opponent's penalty box, receive passes from teammates, and convert them into goals. Therefore, a striker had high goal efficiency is a significant asset. Also, it becomes essential to identify a striker who is proficient with both their left and right foot, also with an ideal height as this attribute aligns with Guardiola's strategic approach (MacGregor, 2015)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d5765091","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7c35f9ae-7fab-465e-b3f9-b1fc5cab40d1","_uuid":"1aa99b09-abfc-43c0-b690-c4f5e2c46bf3","papermill":{"duration":0.009002,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.077435","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.068433","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **METHODOLOGIES**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f47adc96","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e4d240b9-5ac8-431e-995c-a9b2289081ea","_uuid":"6981e578-04f5-444c-a335-6e2b1b91e920","papermill":{"duration":0.007846,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.09329","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.085444","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**DATASET**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0a50e019","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8253c241-0a39-49ef-9bae-236702189295","_uuid":"0ec3bbc6-6323-499b-ac03-95e20a376ed6","papermill":{"duration":0.007938,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.109432","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:07.101494","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Looking an appropirate football databas is one of vital foundation for this project.

On the other hand, Transfermarkt provides up-to-date information on transfers, market values, and player profiles worldwide (Smith, 2021).

code calculates a metric called \"SKORE\" for each player, which represents their potential as a striker. The strkore value is calculated based on various factors, including goals scored per minute played, height, age, market value, current club's domestic competition, and foot preference. The calculation uses a combination of weighted factors to determine the overall strkore value for each player:\n","SKORE rating = (Goals per Match * 60%) + (Height * 15%) + (Age * 10%) + (Market Value * 5%) + (League Factor * 10%) + 10% (Bonus if the striker both left and right footed)\n","1.\tGoals per Match:\n","As target strikers, their primary objective is to consistently score goals. Hence, the goals per match metric carries the highest weight, accounting for 60% of the overall rating. This emphasizes the significance of their goal-scoring ability, with players who have a higher average of goals per match achieving a higher rating in the final evaluation.\n","2.\tHeight (meters):\n","It is worth noting that Aguero, with a height of 173 centimeters, did not possess an ideal height for a striker, which likely impacted his ability to score from crosses. The height of a striker plays a role in their ability to score from crosses and aerial duels. Taller strikers, such as Robert Lewandowski, who can effectively finish crosses, are desirable for Pep Guardiola's system. Therefore, height contributes 15% to the Strkore rating, acknowledging its impact on a striker's overall performance.\n","3.\tAge:\n","To simplify the evaluation, I set the weight where strikers between the ages of 18 and 23 will receive a full mark of 1. This age range reflects the potential for growth, development, and the ability to adapt to the team's requirements (Worville, 2021). On the other hand, strikers outside this age range will receive a reduced mark of 0.5. This accounts for the possibility that older players may have valuable experience and maturity, but their potential for improvement may be less significant.\n","4.\tMarket Value :\n","Considering the budget available to Manchester City in the 2015 transfer window, market value is given a weight of 5% in the Strkore rating. To simplify the calculation, different criteria based on market value ranges are established. Strikers with a market value over 100 million euros receive a mark of 0.5, indicating their high value and significance. Those with a market value between 50 and 100 million euros receive a mark of 0.75, while those below 50 million euros receive a mark of 1. This approach considers the relative financial investment associated with the strikers' potential acquisition.\n","5.\tLeague Factor:\n","The league factor rating takes into account the competitiveness and prestige of the league in which a striker plays. Strikers competing in the top five European leagues, namely the English Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A, receive a full mark of 1. These leagues are recognized for their highly competitive environments, suggesting that the strikers have faced strong opponents (Jiang, 2011). Conversely, strikers in leagues outside the top five receive a reduced mark of 0.5, acknowledging the relatively lower level of competition they typically encounter."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cfff8e3e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009156,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:48.95998","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:48.950824","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["In addition to the analysis presented above, it is worth considering two different approaches for addressing the potential replacement of Aguero. Firstly, a long-term strategy could involve identifying young and promising strikers who have the potential for sustained success over several seasons. This approach requires evaluating factors such as age, performance metrics, and market value to identify emerging talents who can grow and contribute significantly to the team's success in the future. Secondly, a short-term strategy could involve targeting experienced and established strikers who can provide an immediate impact and seamlessly fill the void left by Aguero's departure. This approach requires considering factors such as current form, experience, and compatibility with the team's playing style. By exploring both long-term and short-term options, the team can ensure a smooth transition and maintain their competitive edge in the upcoming seasons."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"85c4c2f4","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009022,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:48.978398","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:48.969376","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**SHORT

conclusion, the analysis of potential replacements for Aguero has identified two distinct approaches: focusing on experienced players and considering young talents.\n","\n","Firstly, let's examine the experienced players. Cristiano Ronaldo, a legendary figure in football, has returned to Manchester United, bringing a wealth of experience and a proven goal-scoring record. His physical presence, goal-scoring ability, and winning mentality make him a compelling option for immediate impact. Luis SuÃ¡rez, who currently plays for AtlÃ©tico de Madrid, is another experienced striker known for his clinical finishing and intelligent movement in the box. With his wealth of experience in top-level competitions, SuÃ¡rez can provide valuable leadership and contribute to the team's success. Robert Lewandowski, currently with FC Barcelona, is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world. His exceptional goal-scoring ability, aerial prowess, and positioning make him a formidable option to lead the line.\n","\n","On the other hand, considering young talents offers a long-term perspective. Moussa DembÃ©lÃ©, who plays for Olympique Lyon, has already shown glimpses of his potential at a young age. Standing at 187 cm tall, DembÃ©lÃ© possesses physical strength and impressive technical skills. His goal-scoring ability and versatility allow him to adapt to different playing styles and provide a fresh dynamic to the team's attack. Kylian MbappÃ©, a rising star in world football, has been dazzling audiences with his speed, agility, and clinical finishing. Playing for Paris Saint-Germain, MbappÃ© has already achieved remarkable success and has the potential to become a generational talent. At just 22 years old, he represents an investment in the future, combining immense talent with a promising trajectory.\n","\n","To make the final decision, several factors must be considered. The team's immediate needs, budgetary constraints, and long-term vision should all play a role in the selection process. Experienced players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis SuÃ¡rez, and Robert Lewandowski offer a guaranteed impact and a winning mentality. On the other hand, young talents like Moussa DembÃ©lÃ© and Kylian MbappÃ© bring excitement, potential, and the prospect of long-term success. The decision should align with the team's overall strategy, considering the balance between short-term performance and long-term sustainability.\n","\n","In conclusion, the search for Aguero's replacement should take into account both experienced players and young talents. By considering the strengths, weaknesses, and potential of each candidate, the team can make an informed decision that aligns with their immediate and long-term objectives. Ultimately, the chosen replacement will have a significant impact on the team's success on and off the field."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f4486081","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.011007,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:49.672611","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:49.661604","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["\n","# **LIMITATION**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"89f1c30c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019828,"end_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:49.706946","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-02T18:11:49.687118","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**Kaggle limitations**: Kaggle, the platform where the code is executed, has certain limitations when it comes to displaying images within Plotly plots. While the code provided allows for the inclusion of player images in the scatter plot, it cannot be directly visualized within Kaggle. However, when running the code in a local Python environment, you should be able to see the images of the players displayed in the scatter plot.\n","\n","**Lack of historical club data**: The dataset used in this example provides information about the current club affiliations of the players but does not include their past club history. This limitation means that the analysis and comparisons made in the code are solely based on the players' current clubs. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from this analysis should be interpreted with the understanding that it only reflects the current state of the players' club affiliations.\n","\n","**Missing data from unpopular leagues**: The dataset used in this example might have limitations in terms of its coverage of football players from less popular or lower-tier leagues. As a result, the analysis may not be fully representative of the entire football landscape. It is important to note that the dataset may lack data for players from less prominent leagues, which could skew the results and conclusions derived from the analysis.\n","\n","It is essential to keep these limitations in mind when interpreting the results and conclusions obtained from the provided code and dataset. While the code showcases a potential approach for analyzing and visualizing player data, it is important to consider the potential biases and limitations inherent in the dataset.
